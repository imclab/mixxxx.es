Mixxxx.es
==========

About
-----
Mixxxx.es streams music from youtube via reddit and user submissions. It was hacked together messily in about 2 hours. The main intended audience for this is a few friends.

By default it streams reddit.com/r/futuregarage and uses a simple database backend to authorise user logins in order to store user submissions. Admins can add boards and add/delete tunes from each board.

To-dos
------

- Add URL support for each board (e.g. mixxxx.es/#future-g).
- Add ability for guests to submit/add songs into the backend (but not modify/delete songs or boards).
- Potentially add support for comments.
- Significant PHP cleanup.
-- Add some security to SQL statements.
-- General organisation and code improvement.
- Add HTML5 BP.
- Remove crappy comments, messy debugging.
