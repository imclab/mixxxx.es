Ideas
==========

### Things we're set on doing.

 	- Convert the playlist bar into more of a player, that never gets interrupted.
 		-- Make videos Play Now/Queue [we won't need all the iframes anymore, use large thumbnails? also makes it easier to store viewcount.]
 		--- Could make player quite large and queue songs underneath.
 	- A rough check for duplicates upon adding to a board.
 	- Ajax-ify the adding of videos/boards.
 	- Be able to remove/edit boards.
 	- Show song titles on queued songs.
  

### Ideas we're playing with/considering.

 	- Custom controls for the player.
 	- Order a board's tunes using a weighting system (upload date 30% / 70% views? note: would need to access/store views).
 	-- Could consider using a up/downvote system or something, but probably not enough users to make it work well.
 	- On default load, chuck a random tune in that is scoring well from clssx/all boards.
 	- Shuffle functions (shuffle a board, or queue?).


### Experimental ideas

	- Public users?
	- If we implement that weighting idea, we could have a 'popular' board of sorts; that chooses high scoring videos across all boards.
